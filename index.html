        <p> Hello, my name is Joseph Kim. I was born in Kent, Washington where
            I've lived all my life. I graduated with a degree in Mathematics from
            the University of Washington, Seattle. After graduating, I briefly
            worked in the IT industry where I spent time problem solving both
            hardware and basic software problems. </p>
